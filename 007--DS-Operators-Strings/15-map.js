/**
CODING CHALLENGE

- Create an array 'event' of the different game events that happened (no duplicates)
- After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64 was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
- Print the following string to the console: "An event happened, on average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)
- Loop over the events and log them to the console, marking whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:
    [FIRST HALF] 17: 丘쬂잺 GOAL
