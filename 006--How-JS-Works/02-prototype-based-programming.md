# Prototype-based programming

Employs the prototype oriented programming (POP) pattern to implement the concept of OOP.

A style of object-oriented programming.

Classes are not explicitly defined, derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class (cloning and reusing already created object to construct another object).

One object can be reused by another object without the need for creating any parent class.

Prototype chain.
